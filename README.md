## 🧵 About This Project

Sweet Lolita Shop is a frontend web application inspired by the beautiful styles found on [devilinspired.com](https://devilinspired.com) and my personal love for Lolita fashion. This project is a passion piece — designed to showcase collections, products, and aesthetics that reflect elegance, creativity, and femininity.

Built with responsive design, clean animations, and intuitive navigation, this site offers a modern frontend experience with a vintage heart.
